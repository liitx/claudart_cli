// step_route.dart — sealed routing instructions for pipeline steps
//
// Every AgentStep declares a routes map: tag → StepRoute.
// The executor switches on the StepRoute to determine what to do next.
// The sealed hierarchy ensures exhaustive switch coverage at compile time.
//
// Routing model:
//   GoTo           → jump to a named step by id
//   QuestionBranch → delegate to a lookup step to answer a question
//   FeedBackTo     → store lookup answer in ctx, return to a named step
//   EscalateUser   → lookup couldn't answer; ask the user, return to named step
//   Complete       → terminal — return the current context
