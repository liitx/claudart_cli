// agent_step.dart — a single step in an agent pipeline
//
// An AgentStep is a self-contained unit of work:
//   - which model to call (or how to pick one from context)
//   - what system prompt to use
//   - how to build the message from current context
//   - which XML tag in the output triggers which route
//
// Model selection:
//   - `model` is the static choice used when [modelSelector] is unset
//     (most steps — categorize, clarify, construct, etc.).
//   - [modelSelector] is the dynamic hook — the executor calls it once
//     per step with the current [PipelineContext] so the categorize
//     step's classification can drive downstream model choice. The
//     selector contract is *total*: it must return an [AgentModel],
//     not null. Selectors that want fallback behaviour on malformed
//     input embed it themselves (see [modelForCategorizeOutput]'s
//     required `fallback:` parameter) — keeping the fallback at the
//     selector site rather than in [effectiveModel] eliminates the
//     "silent fall through to step.model" drift seam.
//
// Routing:
//   routes is empty  → no branching; executor proceeds to next step in list
//   routes non-empty → executor parses output for first matching tag, routes accordingly
//
// All prompt building is deferred to buildPrompt(ctx) so steps are pure
// data — no I/O at declaration time. Tests can inject any PipelineContext.
