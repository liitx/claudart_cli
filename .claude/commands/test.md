# /test — claudart test orchestrator

Full suite runner and global rule enforcer.
Reads feature test files directly to execute their scoped tests and rules inline,
then runs the complete suite with a randomized seed as the final gate.

When to run automatically:
- Any change to `lib/` or `test/`
- Before suggesting a commit message
- After resolving a test failure

---

## Step 0 — Preflight sync check

Before running any tests, verify the workspace is in a consistent state.

```
claudart preflight test
```

- `✓ Preflight clean` — proceed to Step 1.
- `⚠ warnings` — list them in the final report, but proceed. Do not block.
- `✗ errors` — stop. Report the error. Do not run tests until resolved.

The preflight checks:
1. **Skills sync** — if a root cause is confirmed in the handoff, a pending entry must exist in skills.md. A missing entry means `/save` was not run after `/suggest` wrote KT.
2. **Coverage gaps** — any `—` row in a coverage table is a declared gap. Flag each one by filename and scenario name.

---

## Step 1 — Detect scope and execute feature tests inline

Check which files changed (via git diff or recent edits). Find the matching
feature test file below, **read it**, and execute its Step 1 (scoped dart test
command) and Step 2 (module rules) inline before proceeding to the full suite.

How to execute a feature test file inline:
1. Read the file at the path shown above.
2. Run the `dart test` command from its **Step 1**.
3. If tests fail — stop. Do not proceed to the full suite.
4. Check every rule in its **Step 2** against the current code.
5. Report any violations. Stop if any rule is violated.

"All feature files" means read and execute all seven in sequence:
`.claude/commands/test_session.md`, `test_registry.md`, `test_save.md`,
`test_launch.md`, `test_link.md`, `test_commands.md`, `test_readme.md`.

---

## Step 2 — Full suite with random seed

```
CLAUDART_WORKSPACE=/tmp/claudart_test dart test --test-randomize-ordering-seed=random --reporter=expanded
```

Record the seed. If any test fails:
- Report: seed, test name, file, failure message
- Do not proceed to rule checks
- Tell the user: re-run with `--test-randomize-ordering-seed=<seed>` to reproduce

---

## Step 3 — Global rules (checked after full suite passes)

These rules span all modules. They are checked here, not in feature files.

### FileIO abstraction
No `lib/` file except `file_io.dart` and `process_runner.dart` may use
raw `dart:io` for file reads or writes.
```
grep -rn "File(\|Directory(\|Link(" lib/ --include="*.dart" \
  | grep -v "file_io.dart\|process_runner.dart"
```
Any result is a violation.

### Guard coverage
Every command that mutates workspace state calls `withGuard`.
```
grep -rn "writeFile\|fileIO.write\|io.write" lib/commands/ --include="*.dart"
```
Any write outside a `withGuard` call is a violation.

### No circular imports in session/
`session_ops.dart` must not import `workspace_guard.dart`.
`workspace_guard.dart` must not import `session_ops.dart`.
```
grep -n "workspace_guard" lib/session/session_ops.dart
grep -n "session_ops" lib/session/workspace_guard.dart
```
Any result is a violation.

### No dc-flutter context in this repo
```
bash test/claude_md_test.sh
```
All 7 checks must pass.

### Randomization is always used
The `/test` command always passes `--test-randomize-ordering-seed=random`.
Tests must never be run without it during development.
Hard-coded seeds are only acceptable for reproducing a specific failure.

### No repeated test bodies (DRY enforcement)
A test body must never be duplicated. If the same `expect(fn(...), result)` pattern
appears more than once across separate `test()` calls, it must be collapsed into a
data table driven by a single loop:

```dart
const cases = [
  (description: '...', input: ..., expected: ...),
  ...
];
for (final c in cases) {
  test(c.description, () => expect(fn(c.input), c.expected));
}
```

Adding a new case = one new row. The test body is written exactly once.

Check: scan the test file for the specific function under test — if its call appears
in more than one `test()` block, that is a violation.

---

## Step 4 — Promotion check (skills → rules)

Read `.claude/commands/` — scan all feature test files for coverage gaps
marked with `—` in their coverage tables.

Also read `skills.md` in the active workspace (if it exists).
Check if any `## Pending` entry describes a pattern that has appeared in 2+
sessions. If so, flag it for promotion into the relevant feature test file:

> "Pattern X has appeared in N sessions — consider adding it as a rule
> to test_session.md / test_registry.md."

This is how the test suite learns. Skills.md Pending is the incubator.
Feature test files are the enforcement layer.

---

## Step 5 — Final report

```
claudart /test
  Seed    : <seed>
  Passed  : <n> / <n>
  Failed  : 0

Feature rules
  ✓ test_session   (workspace_guard + session_ops)
  ✓ test_registry  (registry)
  ✓ test_save      (save + knowledge chain)
  ✓ test_launch    (launcher)
  ✓ test_link      (link + registry integration)
  ✓ test_commands  (kill + session_state)
  ✓ test_readme    (README glossary + architecture + command routing)

Global rules
  ✓ FileIO abstraction
  ✓ Guard coverage
  ✓ No circular imports
  ✓ No dc-flutter context
  ✓ Randomization enforced

Promotion candidates from skills.md
  none

Safe to commit.
```

If anything fails, list violations with file + line.
Do not say "safe to commit" until all checks pass.
